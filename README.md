Useful links, books, posts about C++
but first ... try to examine yourself.

> So far, C++ has escaped the fate of the Vasa([En](http://www.aristeia.com/TalkNotes/C++vstheVasa2-ups.pdf),[Ru](https://habrahabr.ru/company/infopulse/blog/227529/));  it has not
keeled over and disappeared – despite much wishful
thinking and many dire predictions.
— Bjarne Stroustrup, 1996

## Official online resources
* [The home of Standard C++ on the web](https://isocpp.org/std/status) Standard C++ Foundation is a Washington 501(c)(6) not-for-profit organization whose purpose is to support the C++ software developer community and promote the understanding and use of modern Standard C++ on all compilers and platforms.
    * [C++14,ISO/IEC 14882](http://doc.imzlp.me/viewer.html?file=docs/standard/isocpp2014.pdf)
    * [C++17,N4687 Working Draft](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/n4687.pdf)
    * [Working Draft, Standard for Programming Language C++](https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/)
    * [HTML version of the current C++ working paper](https://github.com/timsong-cpp/cppwp)
* [C++ reference](http://en.cppreference.com/w/) provides programmers with a complete online reference for the C and C++ languages and standard libraries, i.e. a more convenient version of the C and C++ standards. Especially useful for finding examples and documentation of new library features.
* [The C++ Core Guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines.html) are a collaborative effort led by Bjarne Stroustrup & Herb Sutter. The aim of the guidelines is to help people to use modern C++ effectively. (The same is on [GitHub](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines).) The guidelines are focused on relatively higher-level issues, such as interfaces, resource management, memory management and concurrency affecting application architecture and library design. Btw, many rules are designed specifically to be automatically checkable by static analysis tools ([integrated checker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/code-quality/using-the-cpp-core-guidelines-checkers?view=vs-2019) in Visual Studio, [clang-tidy](https://reviews.llvm.org/diffusion/L/browse/clang-tools-extra/trunk/clang-tidy/cppcoreguidelines/)). 
* [clang](http://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html) and [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html)'s support pages.

## Online compilers & tools
Instead of creating local projects you can also leverage some [online compilers](https://arnemertz.github.io/online-compilers/). They offer a basic text editor and usually allow you to compile only one source file (the code that you edit). They are very handy if you want to play with a simple code example.
* [wandbox](https://wandbox.org/), Social Compilation Service that supports GCC and Clang compilers of the up-to-date version. Also you can use boost libraries. Wandbox offers link sharing.
* [tutorialspoint.com](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_cpp_online.php), GCC of latest stable version
* [C++ Quick Benchmark](http://quick-bench.com/) is a micro benchmarking tool intended to quickly and simply compare the performances of two or more code snippets.
* [Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/) allows you to see the assembly of C++ programs generated with different compilers on different platforms.
* [Coliru](http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/) uses GCC 8.1.0 (as of July 2018), offers link sharing and a basic text editor, it’s simple but very effective.
* [C++ Insights](https://cppinsights.io/). It’s a Clang-based tool which does a source to source transformation. It shows how the compiler sees the code, for example by expanding lambdas, auto, structured bindings or range-based for loops.
