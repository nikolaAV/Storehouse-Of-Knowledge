> __I wonder how many great novelists have never read someone else’s work, how many great painters have never studied another’s brush strokes, how many skilled surgeons never learned by looking over a colleague’s shoulder.... And yet that’s what we expect programmers to do.__

> __We become authorities and experts in the practical and scientific spheres by so many separate acts and hours of work. If a person keeps faithfully busy each hour of the working day, he can count on waking up some morning to find himself one of the competent ones of his generation.__

> __Laziness: The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people will find useful, and document what you wrote so that you don’t have to answer so many questions about it.__
>
> -- _Larry Wall_

> __If you haven’t spent at least a month working on the same program—working 16 hours a day, dreaming about it during the remaining 8 hours of restless sleep, working several nights straight through trying to eliminate that “one last bug” from the program—then you haven’t really written a complicated computer program. And you may not have the sense that there is something exhilarating about programming.__

> __The moral virtues, then, are engendered in us neither by nor contrary to nature...their full development in us is due to habit....Anything that we have to learn to do we learn by the actual doing of it....Men will become good builders as a result of building well and bad ones as a result of building badly....So it is a matter of no little importance what sort of habits we form from the earliest age - it makes a vast difference, or rather all the difference in the world.__

> __My message to the serious programmer is: spend a part of your working day examining and refining your own methods. Even though programmers are always struggling to meet some future or past deadline, methodological abstraction is a wise
long-term investment.__
>
> -- _Robert W. Floyd_

> __In the early years of programming, a program was regarded as the private property of the programmer. One would no more think of reading a colleague’s program unbidden than of picking up a love letter and reading it. This is essentially what a program was, a love letter from the programmer to the hardware, full of the intimate details known only to partners in an affair. Consequently, programs became larded with the pet names and verbal shorthand so popular with lovers who live in the blissful abstraction that assumes that theirs is the only existence in the universe. Such programs are unintelligible to those outside the partnership.__

> __Those missing components are also the most accurate (they never make mistakes), the most secure (they can't be broken into), and the easiest to design, document, test and maintain. The importance of a simple design can't be overemphasized.__

> __One man's constant is another man's variable.__
>
> -- _Alan Perlis_

> __The first rule about macros is: Don't use them unless you have to. Almost every macro demonstrates a flaw in the programming language, in the program, or in the programmer.__

> __High-level modules should not depend upon low-level modules. Rather, both should depend upon abstractions. Abstractions should not depend upon details. Rather, details should depend upon abstractions__

> -- _Rober Martin, Dependency Inversion Principle_

> __The most important thing to get right is the interface. Everything else can be fixed later. Get the interface wrong, and you may never be allowed to fix it.__

> -- _Norman Diamond_

> __Systems have sub-systems and sub-systems have subsystems and so on ad infinitum—which is why we're always starting over.__
